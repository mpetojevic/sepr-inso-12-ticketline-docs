User Group Analysis
====================

Introduction
============

The goal is to identify all user groups that interact with the application. For each user group, a detailed analysis of their users must be conducted. This analysis includes the following questions:

    - What knowledge do users have in terms of both domain-specific and technical aspects?
    - How frequently and for how long do users interact with the application?
    - What non-functional requirements do users have for the application, including usability, in-application assistance, data input support, and output of application messages?
    - What are the core functions of the user group?
    - How can the core functions be optimized for the user group?
