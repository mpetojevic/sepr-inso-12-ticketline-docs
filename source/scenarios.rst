Introduction
============

Based on the user group analysis and user stories, scenarios should be developed and documented to illustrate how users interact with the application.
A scenario represents a more complex sequence of actions in which the user interacts with the system to accomplish a specific task using the application.
It may include multiple user stories or combine them. Scenarios should be described textually and modeled using diagrams (e.g., UML activity diagrams).
The primary user interfaces used in the scenarios should be sketched or elaborated upon within the UI prototype (mockups).
Describe how the user interacts with the user interface and the options available to solve the task.
