Software Architecture
=========================

Introduction
=============

The software architecture defines the structure of the application and divides it into various modules. It provides a high-level overview of the entire application but does not delve into implementation details. Standardized UML diagrams, such as component or deployment diagrams, are used for representation.

Architecture Style
------------------

The architecture style employed is:

    - **Architecture Style:** [Specify the architecture style, e.g., Client-Server, Web Application, Three-Tier Architecture, Service-Oriented Architecture, etc.]

Application Structure
----------------------

The application is structured both horizontally and vertically:

    - **Vertical Structure:**
        - Layers: [List the layers used in the application, e.g., Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer]
    - **Horizontal Structure:**
        - Modules: [Specify the modules that constitute the application]

Technologies Used
------------------

The following technologies are utilized:

    - **Programming Language:** [Specify the programming language(s) used]
    - **Application Server / Web Server:** [Specify the application server or web server used]
    - **Frameworks:** [List any frameworks utilized]
    - **Libraries:** [Specify any libraries utilized]
    - **Database:** [Specify the type of database used, e.g., Relational Database, Object-Oriented Database, NoSQL Database, File Storage (XML, CSV), etc.]

Data Storage
------------

Data is stored using the following method(s):

    - **Data Storage:** [Specify how data is stored, e.g., Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), Object-Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS), NoSQL Database, File Storage (XML, CSV), etc.]
