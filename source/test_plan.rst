Test Plan
==============

The Test Plan outlines the strategy to ensure that the developed software system is error-free and meets the specified requirements. It documents which elements of the software system will be tested at different stages of the development process (Test Scope) and how organizational procedures will handle the results of a test run (Test Responsibilities). Additionally, the Test Plan describes how different testing levels will be utilized:

    - Unit Tests: These tests operate at the lowest level, focusing on individual classes or modules.
    - Integration Tests: Integration tests assess the interaction between multiple interdependent components of the system.
    - System Tests: System tests evaluate the entire system against the full set of requirements. This can be done manually or automatically.

Scope
-----
The Test Plan will encompass the following areas:

    - Identification of testable components/modules
    - Assignment of testing responsibilities
    - Definition of testing schedules and milestones
    - Description of testing methodologies and tools
    - Reporting procedures for test results and issues

Responsibilities
----------------
The following roles and responsibilities are defined for testing:

    - Test Manager: Overall responsibility for test planning, execution, and reporting.
    - Development Team: Responsible for unit testing.
    - Quality Assurance Team: Responsible for integration testing and system testing.
    - Project Manager: Oversight and coordination of testing activities.

Test Levels
------------
The Test Plan will include the following test levels:

    - Unit Tests: to be conducted by individual developers.
    - Integration Tests: to be conducted by the Quality Assurance Team.
    - System Tests: to be conducted by the Quality Assurance Team.

Conclusion
----------
The Test Plan is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of the software system. By clearly defining testing strategies, responsibilities, and methodologies, we aim to mitigate risks and deliver a robust solution that meets stakeholder expectations.
