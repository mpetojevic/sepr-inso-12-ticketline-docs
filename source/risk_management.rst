Introduction
============

Risk analysis consists of three steps: risk identification, risk assessment, and risk management. It is conducted using a list of project risks.
Identify potential risks for the project. The risks should be realistic and meaningful.
Assess the risks based on their probability of occurrence and severity of impact if the risk materializes, and calculate the product of these two values.
Develop appropriate countermeasures for the four risks with the highest value and incorporate these countermeasures into the project planning.

Each identified risk should include at least the following information:
