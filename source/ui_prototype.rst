User Interface Prototype (Mockup)
========================================

Overview
============

This page presents the user interface prototype (mockup) of our application. The prototype serves as a graphical representation of the application's design, allowing stakeholders to gain an initial impression of its layout and functionality. Prior to implementation, the prototype facilitates the identification and resolution of design issues and enables early usability testing.

Content
============

The UI prototype has been developed, either with tool support or by hand, encompassing the UI screens of the 10 most critical user stories. It provides an overview of the application's interface, menu navigation, and usability aspects. Stakeholders can explore the prototype to understand the intended user experience and provide feedback for further refinement.

Purpose
============

The purpose of presenting the UI prototype is to solicit feedback from stakeholders and project team members. By showcasing the prototype, we aim to gather insights on the design, usability, and overall user experience of the application. This feedback will inform iterative improvements and enhancements to the user interface before moving forward with implementation.
