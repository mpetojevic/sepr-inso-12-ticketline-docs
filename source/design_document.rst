Development Guidelines
======================

Overview
------------
Development guidelines are intended to assist developers in writing code that is as consistent as possible by providing guidelines for structuring and naming conventions.

Naming Conventions
---------------------

Define naming schemas for:

    - Packages
    - Interfaces
    - Classes
    - Methods
    - Variables (static, local, etc.)

Use the code conventions specific to the programming language being used. For example, for Java, consider the Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language. Note that Oracle no longer maintains the Java Code Conventions, but they are still relevant as they are based on the Java Language Specification. However, if deviations from these conventions are necessary, document them explicitly.

Modern IDEs offer the ability to set formatting rules for source code. These formatting rules can be exported and utilized by the entire development team.
